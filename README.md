# Safe and Personalizable Logical Guidance for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Driving

## Abstract

Autonomous vehicles necessitate a delicate balance between safety, efficiency, and user preferences in trajectory planning. Existing traditional or learning-based methods face challenges in adequately addressing all these aspects. In response, this paper proposes a novel component termed the Logical Guidance Layer (LGL), designed for seamless integration into autonomous driving trajectory planning frameworks, specifically tailored for highway scenarios. The LGL guides the trajectory planning with a local target area determined through scenario reasoning, scenario evaluation, and guidance area calculation. Integrating the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model, the LGL ensures formal safety guarantees while accommodating various user preferences defined by logical formulae. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the LGL in achieving a balance between safety and efficiency, and meeting user preferences in autonomous highway driving scenarios.
